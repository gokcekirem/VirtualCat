# VirtualCat

Digital Design Course Project

This project is a part of Koc University Elec204 - Digital Design course.

The is to create a game where you take care of a cat. The cat’s life decreases if the user does nothing. The cat’s needs are food, love, water, toilet. Each need starts from 25 and decreases if not attended. In total, we will be using 4 buttons and 3 switches.

•	There will be 4 buttons for attending to a need which will increment its number by 1. •	There will be 3 switches to start the game, pause the game, show the cat’s mood.

If the 3 switches are 0, the seven segments will show a cat that moves to the end and returns as an infinite loop. If switch number 1 is equal to 1 and 2 is equal to 0, the game starts.
If switch number 1 is equal to 0 and 2 is equal to 1, the game resets. If switch number 1 and 2 are equal to 1, the game pauses If switch number 3 is equal to 1 when switch number 1 and 2 are equal to 1, the seven segments show us the cat’s mood. Between 20-25, the cat purrs; between 15-20, the cat will look with big eyes (=^o o^=); between 10-15, the cat will be okay (=^ > < ^=); between 5-10, the cat will (=^. .^=); between 0-5, the cat says ‘hsss’; when the cat is dead, it’s eyes will be closed (=^_ _^=).
